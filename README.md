# 433MHzRemoteHacking
Hacking 443MHz signals using MCUNode and as such making those remotes accessible over the internet. Also allows for possible MITM for 443MHz powered keyboards.

I used this to be able to manage things plugged into the mains from my phone.

I will include the detail on how to read radio signals (which you then go onto mock with this 'framework'), and the hardware setup and requirements, soon.
